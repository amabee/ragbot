# The Little Red Riding Hood

## Chapter 1: The Visit to Grandma

Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wore a bright red hooded cape. Everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.

One day, her mother said, "Please take this basket of goodies to Grandma. She is feeling sick."

Little Red Riding Hood promised to be careful and set off through the forest.

## Chapter 2: The Wolf in the Forest

As she walked, a sly wolf appeared.

"Where are you going, little girl?" asked the wolf.

"To my Grandma's house," she replied.

The wolf thought, "I will get there first!" and ran ahead.

## Chapter 3: At Grandmaâ€™s House

The wolf knocked on Grandma's door and quickly went inside.

He dressed up in Grandma's clothes and waited in bed.

When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something was strange.

"Grandma, what big eyes you have!" she said.

"All the better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf.

"Grandma, what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear you with!"

"Grandma, what big teeth you have!"

"All the better to eat you with!" shouted the wolf, jumping out of bed.

## Chapter 4: The Rescue

Just then, a kind woodsman heard the noise and rushed in.

He scared the wolf away and saved Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood.

Everyone was safe and happy again.
