# The Little Red Fox

## Chapter 1: The Curious Fox

Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived a little red fox named Felix.

Felix was very curious. He loved exploring the forest and making new friends.

One sunny morning, Felix decided to go on an adventure to find the sparkling river he had heard about.

## Chapter 2: The New Friends

As Felix walked through the forest, he met a wise old owl named Olive.

"Hello, Felix," said Olive. "Be careful on your adventure!"

Felix thanked Olive and continued on his way.

Soon, he found a playful bunny named Bella hopping near the flowers.

"Would you like to come with me to find the river?" Felix asked.

"Yes, let's go!" Bella replied happily.

## Chapter 3: The Sparkling River

After walking for a while, Felix and Bella finally heard the sound of water.

They reached the sparkling river, shining brightly under the sun.

Felix and Bella played and splashed in the cool water all afternoon.

They promised to go on many more adventures together.
